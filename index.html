      <h1> Welcome to the Home Page</h1>
      <br>
      <p> Verse 1:
        Home page, where the web begins,
        Where the clicks and clicks, and the clicks and clicks begin.
        Where the navigation's clear, and the design's fly,
        Where the users come, and the users don't say goodbye.
        
        Chorus:
        Home page, home page, it's the spot to be,
        Where the users come, and the users come and see.
        Home page, home page, it's the spot to be,
        Where the users come, and the users come and see.
        
        Verse 2:
        With the latest news, and the freshest views,
        Home page, where the real content chooses.
        Where the visuals pop, and the words are tight,
        Where the users stay, and the users come back right.
        
        Chorus:
        Home page, home page, it's the spot to be,
        Where the users come, and the users come and see.
        Home page, home page, it's the spot to be,
        Where the users come, and the users come and see.
        
        Verse 3:
        With a clear call to action, and a strong message,
        Home page, where the users come to make a package.
        Where the contact info is, and the menu's clear,
        Where the users come, and the users come back here.
        
        Chorus:
        Home page, home page, it's the spot to be,
        Where the users come, and the users come and see.
        Home page, home page, it's the spot to be,
        Where the users come, and the users come and see.
        
        Outro:
        So if you want to make an impression, and a lasting one,
        Make sure your home page is where the users come.
        Make it fly, make it tight, make it the spot to be,
        And the users will come, and the users will come and see.</p>
